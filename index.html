        <h1>Proxy vs. Setters Performance Testing</h1>
        <p>
            I wanna use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy">proxies</a>
            so badly because they're the bee's knees.
        </p>
        <p>
            All I ever hear about proxies is that they're cool but slow. Like ... catastrophically
            slow and 100x more sluggish than
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set">setters</a>.
            Sure, I've seen the jsPerf tests and read the doom/gloom blog posts but wanted to play
            around with 'em myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            I got some surprising results, detailed in the table. Especially, what the hell is up
            with Chrome and the single VS multi-setter performance delta? And speaking of Chrome,
            proxies aren't as slow as you might think; in other browsers, yes ... the performance is
            demonstrable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Keep in mind these timings were for 250k actions. That is, setting a value on an object
            250,000 times.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's also a bit of live test output in the faux-console below.
            <a href="https://github.com/phillipluther/proxy-vs-setters-vs-others">Code experiment is here</a>.

        <h2>General Findings for Simple "Set" Actions</h2>
        <p>
            These numbers were recorded on 12/15/2018 in the browsers (on Windows) listed below. I
            have no idea what kind of optimizations have happened since then or how this might
            differ on other operating systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't mess with any reflection or useful intercepts; I just wanted to see bare
            numbers. I'll likely update this with more realistic use cases down the way.

        <p>
            The "Single vs. Multiple" performance test above proved interesting in Chrome when I
            ran it, as with a single setter created via <code>defineProperty</code> performance was
            comparable to a vanilla JS object (10ms vs 4ms, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
            With multiple setters, performance cratered and was actually worse than proxies (64ms
            vs 41ms).

            Also note that I may make this page pretty, someday.
